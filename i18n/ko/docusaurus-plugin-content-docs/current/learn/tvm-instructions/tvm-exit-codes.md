# TVM Exit codes

If TVM exits with an arbitrary 16-bit unsigned integer `exit_code`. `exit_code` higher than 1, it is considered to be an _error code_, therefore an exit with such a code may cause the transaction to revert/bounce. 

## Standard exit codes

:::info
The list of standard exit codes contains all universal TVM exit codes defined for TON Blockchain. Alternative exit codes should be sought in the source code of corresponded contract.

<sup>1</sup> If you encounter such exception in a _func_ contract it probably means a type error in `asm` declarations.
