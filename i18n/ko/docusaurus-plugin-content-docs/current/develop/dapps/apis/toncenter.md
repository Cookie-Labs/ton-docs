# TON Center API

_Standard HTTP JSON RPC. Similar to other blockchain APIs._

Clients connect to the [ton-http-api](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api) server that proxies requests to the liteserver (node) using TonLib.

You can connect to public [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com) or run your own http-api instance.

## Pros & Cons

- ✅ Habitual and suitable for a quick start, this is perfect for every newcomer looking to play with TON. 
- ✅ Web-oriented. Perfect to interact with TON transactions, smart contracts from Web.

- ❌ Simplified. It's not possible to receive information where you need an indexed TON API.  
- ❌ HTTP-Middleware. You can't fully trust server responses, because they do not contain _Merkle proofs_ to validate that your data is genuine.
